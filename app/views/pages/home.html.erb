      <p>All my girls vintage Chanel baby. So you can have your cake. Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air. Slowly swallowing down my fear, yeah yeah. Growing fast into a bolt of lightning. So hot and heavy, 'Til dawn. That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.</p>

      <p>Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed. Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine. Be your teenage dream tonight. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. It's not even a holiday, nothing to celebrate. A perfect storm, perfect storm.</p>

      <p>Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock? There’s no going back. This is the last time you say, after the last line you break. At the eh-end of it all.</p>
